# Multiple-Linear-Regression-Project
# Venture Capitalist Investment Handler

Here we have a dataset of 50 startup companies which includes data of R&D cost, Administration cost, Marketing Spend, States, Profit.
This data is used to know that which company is better for the VC to maximize its profit. 

Using the concept categorical variables to dummy variables and avoiding the dummy variable trap the model is build and optimized version model is also made using Backward Elimination process which shows which independent variable is best statistically suited to the dependent variable.

Few graphs are also plotted to lookout the spread of the data and analyse the data.

Here libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, statsmodel.formula.api is used for various purposes.

The normal model is having accuracy = 93.4 % approx, 
and the optimized version model is having accuracy = 94.6 % approx.

# The Python code and dataset is given in this repository.
