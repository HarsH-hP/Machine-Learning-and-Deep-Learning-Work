# Categorising Customers for business
# K Means Clustering
Here the dataset contains 200 data of customers and its details. 
I categorized customers on the basis of their Salary and Spending Score.

# Using the Elbow method to find out the optimal number of clusters
We use 1-10 clusters and store all the answers and using a plot we can get the optimal number of cluster to build the best model.
Here answer means for given cluster the addition of sqaured distance between all the points with the centroid of the cluster.

Plotting (no. of Cluster) vs (Answer) we can find out the optimal number of clusters required in the model.
We get here {n_clusters = 5}

Using this the model is created to obtain the better categorized output.
