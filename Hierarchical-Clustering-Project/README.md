# Hierarchical Clustering
Here the dataset contains 200 data of customers and its details. We want to categorize customers 
on the basis of their Salary and Spending Score.

The Hierarchical Clustering uses the method of DENDROGRAM which is used to know the optimal number of clusters 
required to build the model.

The diagram of dendrogram here shows that the optimal number of clusters are 5. So using n_clusters = 5 we will build the model and 
categorize the customers.

# Methods of Hierarchical Clustering 
-----Agglomerative Clustering ----(Used here) 

This method uses bottom-up approach where in the start every data is a cluster and than decreasing number of clusters.

-----Divisive Clustering-------

This method uses top-down approach where in the start all data are in 1 cluster and than increasing the number of clusters.
