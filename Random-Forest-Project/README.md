# Random Forest Algorithm
The dataset is Social_Network_Ads and it contains the data of customers who clicks on ads and buys or doesn't buy car. 
The dataset contains the data of customers using which we need to build model to classify that the customer will buy a car or not.

Here i did it using the age and salary of the customers and build a model using Random Forest Classification Algorithm.

Firstly the data needs to be Normalized in order to build the model properly. The model is trained using trained data and using n_estimators = 10
,this means it will use 10 decision tree for a single data and than take average of it. This is the way, Random Forest Algorithm works.

Confusion matrix is used to know the results of our classifier. Following this the plot shows how the model is fitted to the Training data 
and Testing data separately.
