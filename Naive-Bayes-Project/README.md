# Purchasing From Ads Predictor
# Naive Bayes Algorithm
The dataset is Social_Network_Ads and it contains the data of customers who clicks on ads and buys or doesn't buy car. The dataset contains the data of customers using which we need to build model to classify that the customer will buy a car or not.

Here i did it using the age and salary of the customers and build a model using Naive Bayes Algorithm.

The Naive Bayes algorithm will look out the features of the new data that we want to predict and finds out the probability that customer buys and also the probability of customer not buying car.
Comparing them the max valued answer will describe that the customer will buy a car or not.
